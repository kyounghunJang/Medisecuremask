# About the Project
Currently, the medical field is utilizing medical big data for various research and artificial intelligence development. However, in order to utilize these data, it is necessary to de-identify personal information, which is sensitive information. Therefore, <strong>in this project, we created a site where medical data can be de-identified and searched.</strong>
